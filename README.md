# Changelogr
------------

**Changelogr** creates `CHANGELOG.md` files based on your git commits. 
It does come with a default set of themes to match angular.js Changelog Guides, however you can fully customize the MD files by editing the various template files in the template directory.

Beside plain old changelogs, Changelogr is able to build a list of contributors, increment your build number and keep your CHANGELOG up to date with the latest commits. 

Every command is fully flexible by various config files (see `lib/@changelogr.rb`).


This README is sparse because I need more sleep. I'll add the rest tomorrow.
